'Raspbian for Student Robot' is a modified Raspbian install for the Student-Robot project (see 
https://www.student-robot.org/).

The install uses software from many upstream projects, so there are many copyright owners. The 
project makes NO claim of copyright on any upstream software. Please review the instructions how the 
install was created at https://www.schueler-roboter.de/tutorials/create_sr_image/ to learn about 
used software and to review their licenses.
